Nothing fascinates me more than computers. Okay except maybe the human mind, but that's a different story for another day, most likely told by someone that isn't me, and probably on their own website.  
I think that being able to tell computers what to do is amazing and I feel fortunate to be doing this.  
Currently, I'm a Software Engineering student at KTH with a focus on Distributed Systems and also enjoy watching documentaries, animated series (*#bringbackfuturama*) and way too much MMA.  
Also, Thanks for stopping by ðŸ˜Š.
