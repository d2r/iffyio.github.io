I'm Ifeanyi. Nothing fascinates me more than computers. Okay except maybe the human mind but that's a different story for another day, most likely told by someone that isn't me, and probably on their own website. I think that being able to tell computers what to do using code is amazing and I feel fortunate to be doing this.  
I'm currently a Software Engineering Master's student with a focus on Distributed Systems at KTH but when i'm not wrestling with school work, I like to try out new programming languages/paradigms and make stuff on the side with them.  
Beyond that I watch documentaries, animated series *#bringbackfuturama* and way too much MMA.  
  
  Say Hi back using ifeanyiub#gmail.com or using of the links down there.  

Also, Thanks for stopping by ðŸ˜Š.
